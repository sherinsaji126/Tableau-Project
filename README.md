🚀 Excited to share my latest project using Tableau! 🚀

I have developed an interactive dashboard to analyze Airbnb data for Seattle, Washington. This dashboard provides comprehensive insights into various aspects of Airbnb listings, including revenue trends, pricing, and distribution of room types. 
Here’s a detailed breakdown:

Creating the Seattle Airbnb Analysis Dashboard in Tableau:

A) Prepare Data  For Exploration :
Import the Airbnb dataset into Tableau. This can be done by connecting Tableau to the data source, which could be a CSV file, Excel file.

B) Process Data From Dirty To Clean
Clean the data to ensure it is in the correct format. This may include handling missing values, correcting data types, and creating any necessary calculated fields.

C) Create Measures using Calculated Field:
Use calculated fields to count the distinct listings ,hosts, etc.

D) Share Data Through the Art of Visualization:
Include visuals: Drag and drop visuals into the report canvas, such as tables, pie charts, and bar charts.                                                    Personalise the visuals: You can alter the way the visuals look by using the formatting options.

E) Add Filters and Interactivity:
Add any necessary filters to allow users to interact with the dashboard. For example, a filter to select the number of bedrooms.
Ensure that the filters are applied to all relevant sheets to maintain consistency.

Conclusion-> By following these steps, you can create an informative and interactive dashboard that provides valuable insights into Seattle's Airbnb market.

📊 The dashboard offers key insights such as:
🏡 Revenue trends throughout the year, highlighting an average monthly revenue of $15M.
💲 Average price per bedroom, with a striking $895 for 13-bedroom listings.
🏘 Most popular room types, dominated by entire home/apartment listings.
📈 Distribution of listings across different neighborhoods, with Seattle having the highest concentration.
